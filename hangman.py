# This project makes use of GitHub as its version control.
# In this project, I will implement the game hangman. Initially the user will be allowed to select 
# the difficulty by typing in easy/medium/hard. Then the program will print out a empty gallows with # blanks displayed for the unknow letters of the word. For each mistake the gallows will be displayed# with an additional body part. The user will be given 5 mistakes before the hangman image is
# completed and "Game Over: You word was ___________". The words to be guessed are selected at random
# from an input file.
